# MarkovChainPredictiveText
A simple predictive text system that uses a Markov chain.

Enter source text on the left, type as a user might on the right. Default sample text comes from Hansard, the UK goverernment's record of what politicians say in the Houses of Parliament.

Intended more as personal education than anything else, but feel free to use for whatever you feel like. I'm sure there are more efficient and flexible libraries dedicated to Markov Chains, but this might be useful for education.
